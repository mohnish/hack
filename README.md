# Hack

A very basic text editor for the hacker in you.

## Why?

A better question is - "why not?". I've always wanted to create a text editor for myself and this is my attempt at it.

## Philosophy

My philosophy is to *reinvent the wheel* with this project. Don't get me wrong, that's not how I always work in projects outside this one. It mostly depends on the use case. This is more of an experiment that involves me learning a lot of new things.

## Goal

The goal here is to build a text editor that is fast and extensible.

## Features

*Hack* is going to be a very light weight and bare bones text editor.

## Who is this for?

Chances are that *Hack* is not for you. This is being built for me. However, you can fork it and add features, fix bugs, add docs, remove features or do whatever you want with it. It's an open source project after all.
